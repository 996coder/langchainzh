 How to write a custom LLM wrapper

=========================================================================================================
 This notebook goes over how to create a custom LLM wrapper, in case you want to use your own LLM or a different wrapper than one that is supported in LangChain.
 There is only one required thing that a custom LLM needs to implement:
1. A
 `\_call`
 method that takes in a string, some optional stop words, and returns a string
 There is a second optional thing it can implement:
1. An
 `\_identifying\_params`
 property that is used to help with printing of this class. Should return a dictionary.
 Letâ€™s implement a very simple custom LLM that just returns the first N characters of the input.
```
from langchain.llms.base import LLM
from typing import Optional, List, Mapping, Any
```
```
class CustomLLM(LLM):
    n: int
    @property
    def \_llm\_type(self) -> str:
        return "custom"
    def \_call(self, prompt: str, stop: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> str:
        if stop is not None:
            raise ValueError("stop kwargs are not permitted.")
        return prompt[:self.n]
    @property
    def \_identifying\_params(self) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
 """Get the identifying parameters."""
        return {"n": self.n}
```
 We can now use this as an any other LLM.
```
llm = CustomLLM(n=10)
```
```
llm("This is a foobar thing")
```
```
'This is a '
```
 We can also print the LLM and see its custom print.
```
print(llm)
```
```
CustomLLM
Params: {'n': 10}
```
