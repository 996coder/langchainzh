 How (and why) to use the fake LLM
 [#](#how-and-why-to-use-the-fake-llm "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================================================================
 We expose a fake LLM class that can be used for testing. This allows you to mock out calls to the LLM and simulate what would happen if the LLM responded in a certain way.
 In this notebook we go over how to use this.
 We start this with using the FakeLLM in an agent.
```
from langchain.llms.fake import FakeListLLM
```
```
from langchain.agents import load\_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
```
```
tools = load\_tools(["python\_repl"])
```
```
responses=[
    "Action: Python REPL\nAction Input: print(2 + 2)",
    "Final Answer: 4"
]
llm = FakeListLLM(responses=responses)
```
```
agent = initialize\_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```
```
agent.run("whats 2 + 2")
```
```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Action: Python REPL
Action Input: print(2 + 2)
Observation: 4
Thought:Final Answer: 4
> Finished chain.
```
```
'4'
