 Weights & Biases
 [#](#weights-biases "Permalink to this headline")
=====================================================================



 This notebook goes over how to track your LangChain experiments into one centralized Weights and Biases dashboard. To learn more about prompt engineering and the callback please refer to this Report which explains both alongside the resultant dashboards you can expect to see.

Callback Handler that logs to Weights and Biases.

Parameters:
    job_type (str): The type of job.
    project (str): The project to log to.
    entity (str): The entity to log to.
    tags (list): The tags to log.
    group (str): The group to log to.
    name (str): The name of the run.
    notes (str): The notes to log.
    visualize (bool): Whether to visualize the run.
    complexity_metrics (bool): Whether to log complexity metrics.
    stream_logs (bool): Whether to stream callback actions to W&B

```






```
Default values for WandbCallbackHandler(...)

visualize: bool = False,
complexity_metrics: bool = False,
stream_logs: bool = False,

```




 NOTE: For beta workflows we have made the default analysis based on textstat and the visualizations based on spacy

wandb: WARNING The wandb callback is currently in beta and is subject to change based on updates to `langchain`. Please report any issues to https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues with the tag `langchain`.

```








```
# Defaults for WandbCallbackHandler.flush_tracker(...)

reset: bool = True,
finish: bool = False,

```




 The
 `flush_tracker`
 function is used to log LangChain sessions to Weights & Biases. It takes in the LangChain module or agent, and logs at minimum the prompts and generations alongside the serialized form of the LangChain module to the specified Weights & Biases project. By default we reset the session as opposed to concluding the session outright.
 







```
# SCENARIO 1 - LLM
llm_result = llm.generate(["Tell me a joke", "Tell me a poem"] \* 3)
wandb_callback.flush_tracker(llm, name="simple_sequential")

```

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out who Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is and then calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"
Observation: DiCaprio had a steady girlfriend in Camila Morrone. He had been with the model turned actress for nearly five years, as they were first said to be dating at the end of 2017. And the now 26-year-old Morrone is no stranger to Hollywood.
Thought: I need to calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 26^0.43
Observation: Answer: 4.059182145592686

Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is Camila Morrone and her current age raised to the 0.43 power is 4.059182145592686.
