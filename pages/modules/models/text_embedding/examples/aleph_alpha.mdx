 Aleph Alpha

=============================================================
 There are two possible ways to use Aleph Alphaâ€™s semantic embeddings. If you have texts with a dissimilar structure (e.g. a Document and a Query) you would want to use asymmetric embeddings. Conversely, for texts with comparable structures, symmetric embeddings are the suggested approach.
 Asymmetric

-----------------------------------------------------------
```
from langchain.embeddings import AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding
```
```
document = "This is a content of the document"
query = "What is the contnt of the document?"
```
```
embeddings = AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding()
```
```
doc\_result = embeddings.embed\_documents([document])
```
```
query\_result = embeddings.embed\_query(query)
```
 Symmetric

---------------------------------------------------------
```
from langchain.embeddings import AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding
```
```
text = "This is a test text"
```
```
embeddings = AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding()
```
```
doc\_result = embeddings.embed\_documents([text])
```
```
query\_result = embeddings.embed\_query(text)
```
