 Sentence Transformers Embeddings
 [#](#sentence-transformers-embeddings "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================================================================
[SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) 
 embeddings are called using the
 `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`
 integration. We have also added an alias for
 `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings`
 for users who are more familiar with directly using that package.
 SentenceTransformers is a python package that can generate text and image embeddings, originating from
 [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) 
```
!pip install sentence_transformers > /dev/null
```
```
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 23.0.1 -> 23.1.1
[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
```
```
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings, SentenceTransformerEmbeddings 
```
```
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model\_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
# Equivalent to SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model\_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```
```
text = "This is a test document."
```
```
query\_result = embeddings.embed\_query(text)
```
```
doc\_result = embeddings.embed\_documents([text, "This is not a test document."])
