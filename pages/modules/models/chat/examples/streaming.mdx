=====================================================================================
 This notebook goes over how to use streaming with a chat model.
```
from langchain.chat\_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import (
    HumanMessage,
)
```
```
from langchain.callbacks.base import CallbackManager
from langchain.callbacks.streaming\_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
chat = ChatOpenAI(streaming=True, callback\_manager=CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]), verbose=True, temperature=0)
resp = chat([HumanMessage(content="Write me a song about sparkling water.")])
```
```
Verse 1:
Bubbles rising to the top
A refreshing drink that never stops
Clear and crisp, it's pure delight
A taste that's sure to excite
Chorus:
Sparkling water, oh so fine
A drink that's always on my mind
With every sip, I feel alive
Sparkling water, you're my vibe
Verse 2:
No sugar, no calories, just pure bliss
A drink that's hard to resist
It's the perfect way to quench my thirst
A drink that always comes first
Chorus:
Sparkling water, oh so fine
A drink that's always on my mind
With every sip, I feel alive
Sparkling water, you're my vibe
Bridge:
From the mountains to the sea
Sparkling water, you're the key
To a healthy life, a happy soul
A drink that makes me feel whole
Chorus:
Sparkling water, oh so fine
A drink that's always on my mind
With every sip, I feel alive
Sparkling water, you're my vibe
Outro:
Sparkling water, you're the one
A drink that's always so much fun
I'll never let you go, my friend
Sparkling
