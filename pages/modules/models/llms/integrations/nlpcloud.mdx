 This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with
 `NLP
 Cloud`
[models](https://docs.nlpcloud.com/#models) 
 .
```
!pip install nlpcloud
```
```
# get a token: https://docs.nlpcloud.com/#authentication
from getpass import getpass
NLPCLOUD\_API\_KEY = getpass()
```
```
import os
os.environ["NLPCLOUD\_API\_KEY"] = NLPCLOUD\_API\_KEY
```
```
from langchain.llms import NLPCloud
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
```
```
template = """Question: {question}
Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input\_variables=["question"])
```
```
llm = NLPCloud()
```
```
llm\_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```
```
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"
llm\_chain.run(question)
```
```
' Justin Bieber was born in 1994, so the team that won the Super Bowl that year was the San Francisco 49ers.'
