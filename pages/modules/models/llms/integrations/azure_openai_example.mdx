 Azure OpenAI
 [#](#azure-openai "Permalink to this headline")
===============================================================
 This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with
 [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai) 
 .
 The Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI’s API. The
 `openai`
 Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.
 API configuration
 [#](#api-configuration "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can configure the
 `openai`
 package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables. The following is for
 `bash`
 :
```
# Set this to `azure`
export OPENAI\_API\_TYPE=azure
# The API version you want to use: set this to `2022-12-01` for the released version.
export OPENAI\_API\_VERSION=2022-12-01
# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource. You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export OPENAI\_API\_BASE=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
# The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource. You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export OPENAI\_API\_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key>
```
 Alternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:
```
import os
os.environ["OPENAI\_API\_TYPE"] = "azure"
...
```
 Deployments
 [#](#deployments "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------
 With Azure OpenAI, you set up your own deployments of the common GPT-3 and Codex models. When calling the API, you need to specify the deployment you want to use.
 Let’s say your deployment name is
 `text-davinci-002-prod`
 . In the
 `openai`
 Python API, you can specify this deployment with the
 `engine`
 parameter. For example:
```
import openai
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-002-prod",
    prompt="This is a test",
    max\_tokens=5
)
```
```
!pip install openai
```
```
# Import Azure OpenAI
from langchain.llms import AzureOpenAI
```
```
# Create an instance of Azure OpenAI
# Replace the deployment name with your own
llm = AzureOpenAI(deployment\_name="text-davinci-002-prod", model\_name="text-davinci-002")
```
```
# Run the LLM
llm("Tell me a joke")
```
```
'\n\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get to the other side.'
```
 We can also print the LLM and see its custom print.
```
print(llm)
```
```
