 SageMakerEndpoint
 [#](#sagemakerendpoint "Permalink to this headline")
=========================================================================
[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) 
 is a system that can build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows.
 This notebooks goes over how to use an LLM hosted on a
 `SageMaker
 endpoint`
 .
```
!pip3 install langchain boto3
```
 Set up
 [#](#set-up "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------
 You have to set up following required parameters of the
 `SagemakerEndpoint`
 call:
* `endpoint\_name`
 : The name of the endpoint from the deployed Sagemaker model.
Must be unique within an AWS Region.
* `credentials\_profile\_name`
 : The name of the profile in the ~/.aws/credentials or ~/.aws/config files, which
has either access keys or role information specified.
If not specified, the default credential profile or, if on an EC2 instance,
credentials from IMDS will be used.
See: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html

Peter and Elizabeth took a taxi to attend the night party in the city. While in the party, Elizabeth collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.
Since she was diagnosed with a brain injury, the doctor told Peter to stay besides her until she gets well.
Therefore, Peter stayed with her at the hospital for 3 days without leaving.
