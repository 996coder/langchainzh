 Writer
 [#](#writer "Permalink to this headline")
===================================================
[Writer](https://writer.com/) 
 is a platform to generate different language content.
 This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with
 `Writer`
[models](https://dev.writer.com/docs/models) 
 .
 You have to get the WRITER\_API\_KEY
 [here](https://dev.writer.com/docs) 
 .
```
from getpass import getpass
WRITER\_API\_KEY = getpass()
```
```
import os
os.environ["WRITER\_API\_KEY"] = WRITER\_API\_KEY
```
```
from langchain.llms import Writer
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
```
```
template = """Question: {question}
Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input\_variables=["question"])
```
```
# If you get an error, probably, you need to set up the "base\_url" parameter that can be taken from the error log.
llm = Writer()
```
```
llm\_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```
```
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"
llm\_chain.run(question)
```
