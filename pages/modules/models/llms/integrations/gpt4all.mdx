 GPT4All
 [#](#gpt4all "Permalink to this headline")
=====================================================
[GitHub:nomic-ai/gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) 
 an ecosystem of open-source chatbots trained on a massive collections of clean assistant data including code, stories and dialogue.
 This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with
 `GPT4All`
 models.
```
%pip install pyllamacpp > /dev/null
```
```
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```
```
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.llms import GPT4All
from langchain.callbacks.base import CallbackManager
from langchain.callbacks.streaming\_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
```
```
template = """Question: {question}
Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input\_variables=["question"])
```

 To run locally, download a compatible ggml-formatted model. For more info, visit https://github.com/nomic-ai/pyllamacpp
 For full installation instructions go
 [here](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) 
 .
 The GPT4All Chat installer needs to decompress a 3GB LLM model during the installation process!
 Note that new models are uploaded regularly - check the link above for the most recent
 `.bin`
 URL
```
local\_path = './models/gpt4all-lora-quantized-ggml.bin'  # replace with your desired local file path
```
 Uncomment the below block to download a model. You may want to update
 `url`
 to a new version.
```
# import requests
# from pathlib import Path
# from tqdm import tqdm
# Path(local\_path).parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist\_ok=True)
# # Example model. Check https://github.com/nomic-ai/pyllamacpp for the latest models.
# url = 'https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-quantized-ggml.bin'
# # send a GET request to the URL to download the file. Stream since it's large
# response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
# # open the file in binary mode and write the contents of the response to it in chunks
# # This is a large file, so be prepared to wait.
# with open(local\_path, 'wb') as f:
# for chunk in tqdm(response.iter\_content(chunk\_size=8192)):
# if chunk:
# f.write(chunk)
```
```
# Callbacks support token-wise streaming
callback\_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()])
# Verbose is required to pass to the callback manager
llm = GPT4All(model=local\_path, callback\_manager=callback\_manager, verbose=True)
```
```
llm\_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```
```
question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born?"
llm\_chain.run(question)
```
