 How to track token usage
 [#](#how-to-track-token-usage "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================================================
 This notebook goes over how to track your token usage for specific calls. It is currently only implemented for the OpenAI API.
 Let’s first look at an extremely simple example of tracking token usage for a single LLM call.
```
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.callbacks import get\_openai\_callback
```
```
llm = OpenAI(model\_name="text-davinci-002", n=2, best\_of=2)
```
```
with get\_openai\_callback() as cb:
    result = llm("Tell me a joke")
    print(cb)
```
```
Tokens Used: 42
	Prompt Tokens: 4
	Completion Tokens: 38
Successful Requests: 1
Total Cost (USD): $0.00084
```
 Anything inside the context manager will get tracked. Here’s an example of using it to track multiple calls in sequence.
```
with get\_openai\_callback() as cb:
    result = llm("Tell me a joke")
    result2 = llm("Tell me a joke")
    print(cb.total\_tokens)
```
```
91
```
 If a chain or agent with multiple steps in it is used, it will track all those steps.
```
from langchain.agents import load\_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load\_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize\_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT\_REACT\_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```
```
with get\_openai\_callback() as cb:
    response = agent.run("Who is Olivia Wilde's boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?")
    print(f"Total Tokens: {cb.total\_tokens}")
    print(f"Prompt Tokens: {cb.prompt\_tokens}")
    print(f"Completion Tokens: {cb.completion\_tokens}")
    print(f"Total Cost (USD): ${cb.total\_cost}")
```
```

 I need to find out who Olivia Wilde's boyfriend is and then calculate his age raised to the 0.23 power.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Olivia Wilde boyfriend"
Observation: Sudeikis and Wilde's relationship ended in November 2020. Wilde was publicly served with court documents regarding child custody while she was presenting Don't Worry Darling at CinemaCon 2022. In January 2021, Wilde began dating singer Harry Styles after meeting during the filming of Don't Worry Darling.
Thought: I need to find out Harry Styles' age.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Harry Styles age"
Observation: 29 years
Thought: I need to calculate 29 raised to the 0.23 power.
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 29^0.23
Observation: Answer: 2.169459462491557
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde's boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557.
