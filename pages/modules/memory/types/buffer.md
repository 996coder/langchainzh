 [#](#conversationbuffermemory "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================================================



 This notebook shows how to use
 `ConversationBufferMemory`
 . This memory allows for storing of messages and then extracts the messages in a variable.
 



 We can first extract it as a string.
 







```
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

```










```
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"ouput": "whats up"})

```










```
memory.load_memory_variables({})

```








```
{'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}

```






 We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).
 







```
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"ouput": "whats up"})

```










```
memory.load_memory_variables({})

```








```
{'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
  AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}

```







 Using in a chain
 [#](#using-in-a-chain "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 Finally, let’s take a look at using this in a chain (setting
 `verbose=True`
 so we can see the prompt).
 







```
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    verbose=True, 
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

```










```
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")

```








```
> Entering new ConversationChain chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:

> Finished chain.

```






```
" Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"

```










```
conversation.predict(input="I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")

```

" That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"

```










```
conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")

```

" Sure! I'm an AI created to help people with their everyday tasks. I'm programmed to understand natural language and provide helpful information. I'm also constantly learning and updating my knowledge base so I can provide more accurate and helpful answers."

 And that’s it for the getting started! There are plenty of different types of memory, check out our examples to see them all
