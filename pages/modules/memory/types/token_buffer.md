 [#](#conversationtokenbuffermemory "Permalink to this headline")
=================================================================================================



`ConversationTokenBufferMemory`
 keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.
 



 Let’s first walk through how to use the utilities
 







```
from langchain.memory import ConversationTokenBufferMemory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI()

```










```
memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"ouput": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"ouput": "not much"})

```










```
memory.load_memory_variables({})

```








```
{'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}

```






 We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).
 







```
memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"ouput": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"ouput": "not much"})

```







 Using in a chain

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 Let’s walk through an example, again setting
 `verbose=True`
 so we can see the prompt.
 







```
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.
    memory=ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=60),
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")

```








```

Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi, what's up?
AI:

```
" Hi there! I'm doing great, just enjoying the day. How about you?"

```










```
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Just working on writing some documentation!")

```
" Yes, I have heard of LangChain! It is a decentralized language-learning platform that connects native speakers and learners in real time. Is that the documentation you're writing about?"

```










```
# We can see here that the buffer is updated
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Haha nope, although a lot of people confuse it for that")
