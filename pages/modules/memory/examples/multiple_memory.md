 How to use multiple memory classes in the same chain

===============================================================================================================================================



 It is also possible to use multiple memory classes in the same chain. To combine multiple memory classes, we can initialize the
 `CombinedMemory`
 class, and then use that.
 







```
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, CombinedMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory


conv_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history_lines",
    input_key="input"
)

summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key="input")
# Combined
memory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory])
_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input", "chat_history_lines"], template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE
)
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    verbose=True, 
    memory=memory,
    prompt=PROMPT
