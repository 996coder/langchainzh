 Deep Lake

>  as a Multi-Modal Vector Store that stores embeddings and their metadata including text, jsons, images, audio, video, and more. It saves the data locally, in your cloud, or on Activeloop storage. It performs hybrid search including embeddings and their attributes.

 This notebook showcases basic functionality related to
 `Deep
 Lake`
 . While
 `Deep
 Lake`
 can store embeddings, it is capable of storing any type of data. It is a fully fledged serverless data lake with version control, query engine and streaming dataloader to deep learning frameworks.
 For more information, please see the Deep Lake
 [documentation](https://docs.activeloop.ai) 
 or
 [api reference](https://docs.deeplake.ai) 
```
!pip install openai deeplake tiktoken
```
```
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text\_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake
```
```

text\_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk\_size=1000, chunk\_overlap=0)
docs = text\_splitter.split\_documents(documents)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```
 Creates a dataset locally at
 `./deeplake/`
 , then runs similiarity search
```
db = DeepLake(dataset\_path="./my\_deeplake/", embedding\_function=embeddings)
db.add\_documents(docs)
# or shorter
# db = DeepLake.from\_documents(docs, dataset\_path="./my\_deeplake/", embedding=embeddings, overwrite=True)

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 
One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```
 Later, you can reload the dataset without recomputing embeddings
```
db = DeepLake(dataset\_path="./my\_deeplake/", embedding\_function=embeddings, read\_only=True)
docs = db.similarity\_search(query)
```
```
./my_deeplake/ loaded successfully.

 Deep Lake, for now, is single writer and multiple reader. Setting
 `read\_only=True`
 helps to avoid acquring the writer lock.
