Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 
One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

 Persistance
 [#](#persistance "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------
 The below steps cover how to persist a ChromaDB instance
### 
 Initialize PeristedChromaDB
 [#](#initialize-peristedchromadb "Permalink to this headline")
 Create embeddings for each chunk and insert into the Chroma vector database. The persist\_directory argument tells ChromaDB where to store the database when it’s persisted.
```
# Embed and store the texts
# Supplying a persist\_directory will store the embeddings on disk
persist\_directory = 'db'
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from\_documents(documents=docs, embedding=embedding, persist\_directory=persist\_directory)
```
```
Running Chroma using direct local API.

### 
 Persist the Database
 [#](#persist-the-database "Permalink to this headline")
 We should call persist() to ensure the embeddings are written to disk.
```
vectordb.persist()
vectordb = None
```
```
Persisting DB to disk, putting it in the save folder db
PersistentDuckDB del, about to run persist
Persisting DB to disk, putting it in the save folder db
```
### 
 Load the Database from disk, and create the chain
 [#](#load-the-database-from-disk-and-create-the-chain "Permalink to this headline")
 Be sure to pass the same persist\_directory and embedding\_function as you did when you instantiated the database. Initialize the chain we will use for question answering.
```
# Now we can load the persisted database from disk, and use it as normal. 
vectordb = Chroma(persist\_directory=persist\_directory, embedding\_function=embedding)
```
```
Running Chroma using direct local API.

 Retriever options
 [#](#retriever-options "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This section goes over different options for how to use Chroma as a retriever.
### 
 MMR
 [#](#mmr "Permalink to this headline")
 In addition to using similarity search in the retriever object, you can also use
 `mmr`
 .
```
retriever = db.as\_retriever(search\_type="mmr")
```
```
retriever.get\_relevant\_documents(query)[0]
```
```
