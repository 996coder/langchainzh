 ElasticSearch
 [#](#elasticsearch "Permalink to this headline")
=================================================================
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) 
 is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.
 This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the
 `Elasticsearch`
 database.
 Installation
 [#](#installation "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------
 Check out
 [Elasticsearch installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html) 
 .
 To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that does not require
login credentials, pass the Elasticsearch URL and index name along with the
embedding object to the constructor.
 Example:
```
        from langchain import ElasticVectorSearch
        from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
        embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
        elastic\_vector\_search = ElasticVectorSearch(
            elasticsearch\_url="http://localhost:9200",
            index\_name="test\_index",
            embedding=embedding
        )
```
 To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that requires login credentials,
including Elastic Cloud, use the Elasticsearch URL format
https://username:password@es\_host:9243. For example, to connect to Elastic
Cloud, create the Elasticsearch URL with the required authentication details and
pass it to the ElasticVectorSearch constructor as the named parameter
elasticsearch\_url.
 You can obtain your Elastic Cloud URL and login credentials by logging in to the
Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co, selecting your deployment, and
navigating to the “Deployments” page.
 To obtain your Elastic Cloud password for the default “elastic” user:
1. Log in to the Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co
2. Go to “Security” > “Users”
3. Locate the “elastic” user and click “Edit”
4. Click “Reset password”
5. Follow the prompts to reset the password
 Format for Elastic Cloud URLs is
https://username:password@cluster\_id.region\_id.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243.
 Example:
```
        from langchain import ElasticVectorSearch
        from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
        embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
        elastic\_host = "cluster\_id.region\_id.gcp.cloud.es.io"
        elasticsearch\_url = f"https://username:password@{elastic\_host}:9243"
        elastic\_vector\_search = ElasticVectorSearch(
            elasticsearch\_url=elasticsearch\_url,
            index\_name="test\_index",
            embedding=embedding
        )
```
```
!pip install elasticsearch
```
```
import os
import getpass
os.environ['OPENAI\_API\_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```
 Example

-----------------------------------------------------
```
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text\_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import ElasticVectorSearch
from langchain.document\_loaders import TextLoader
```
```
from langchain.document\_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../../state\_of\_the\_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text\_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk\_size=1000, chunk\_overlap=0)
docs = text\_splitter.split\_documents(documents)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```
```
db = ElasticVectorSearch.from\_documents(docs, embeddings, elasticsearch\_url="http://localhost:9200")
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity\_search(query)
```
```
print(docs[0].page\_content)
```
```
In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. 
We cannot let this happen. 
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 
One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
