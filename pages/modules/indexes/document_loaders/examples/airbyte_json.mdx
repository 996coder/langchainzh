 [#](#airbyte-json "Permalink to this headline")
===============================================================
 This covers how to load any source from Airbyte into a local JSON file that can be read in as a document
 Prereqs:
Have docker desktop installed
 Steps:
1. Clone Airbyte from GitHub -
 `git
 clone
 https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git`
2. Switch into Airbyte directory -
 `cd
 airbyte`
3. Start Airbyte -
 `docker
 compose
 up`
4. In your browser, just visit http://localhost:8000. You will be asked for a username and password. By default, that’s username
 `airbyte`

8. To see what files are create, you can navigate to:
 `file:///tmp/airbyte\_local`

 `/tmp/airbyte\_local`
```
from langchain.document\_loaders import AirbyteJSONLoader
```
```
!ls /tmp/airbyte_local/json_data/
```
```
_airbyte_raw_pokemon.jsonl
```
```
loader = AirbyteJSONLoader('/tmp/airbyte\_local/json\_data/\_airbyte\_raw\_pokemon.jsonl')
```
```
data = loader.load()
```
```
print(data[0].page\_content[:500])
```
