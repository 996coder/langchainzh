 Export your dataset from Roam Research. You can do this by clicking on the three dots in the upper right hand corner and then clicking
 `Export`
 .
 When exporting, make sure to select the
 `Markdown
 &
 CSV`
 format option.
 This will produce a
 `.zip`
 file in your Downloads folder. Move the
 `.zip`
 file into this repository.
 Run the following command to unzip the zip file (replace the
 `Export...`
 with your own file name as needed).
```
unzip Roam-Export-1675782732639.zip -d Roam_DB
```
```
from langchain.document\_loaders import RoamLoader
```
```
loader = ObsidianLoader("Roam\_DB")
```
```
docs = loader.load()
```
