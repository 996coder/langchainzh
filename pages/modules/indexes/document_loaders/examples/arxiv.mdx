 Arxiv
 [#](#arxiv "Permalink to this headline")
=================================================
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) 
 is an open-access archive for 2 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.
 This notebook shows how to load scientific articles from
 `Arxiv.org`
 into a document format that we can use downstream.
 Installation
 [#](#installation "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------
 First, you need to install
 `arxiv`
 python package.
```
!pip install arxiv
```
 Second, you need to install
 `PyMuPDF`
 python package which transform PDF files from the
 `arxiv.org`
 site into the text fromat.
```
!pip install pymupdf
```

-------------------------------------------------------
`ArxivLoader`
 has these arguments:
* `query`
 : free text which used to find documents in the Arxiv
* optional
 `load\_max\_docs`
 : default=100. Use it to limit number of downloaded documents. It takes time to download all 100 documents, so use a small number for experiments.
* optional
 `load\_all\_available\_meta`
 : default=False. By defaul only the most important fields downloaded:
 `Published`
 (date when document was published/last updated),
 `Title`
 ,
 `Authors`
 ,
 `Summary`
 . If True, other fields also downloaded.
```
from langchain.document\_loaders.base import Document
from langchain.document\_loaders import ArxivLoader
```
```
docs = ArxivLoader(query="1605.08386", load\_max\_docs=2).load()
len(docs)
```
