 [#](#obsidian "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================



 This notebook covers how to load documents from an Obsidian database.
 



 Since Obsidian is just stored on disk as a folder of Markdown files, the loader just takes a path to this directory.
 



 Obsidian files also sometimes contain
 [metadata](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Metadata) 
 which is a YAML block at the top of the file. These values will be added to the documentâ€™s metadata. (
 `ObsidianLoader`
 can also be passed a
 `collect_metadata=False`
 argument to disable this behavior.)
 







```
from langchain.document_loaders import ObsidianLoader

```










```
loader = ObsidianLoader("<path-to-obsidian>")

```










```
docs = loader.load()

```
