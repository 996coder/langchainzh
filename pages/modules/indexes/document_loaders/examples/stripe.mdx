 Stripe
 [#](#stripe "Permalink to this headline")
===================================================
 This notebook covers how to load data from the Stripe REST API into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for vectorization.
```
import os
from langchain.document\_loaders import StripeLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
```
 The Stripe API requires an access token, which can be found inside of the Stripe dashboard.
 This document loader also requires a
 `resource`
 option which defines what data you want to load.
 Following resources are available:
`balance\_transations`
[Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance_transactions/list) 
`charges`
[Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/list) 
`customers`
[Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/list) 
`events`
[Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/list) 
`refunds`
[Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/refunds/list) 
`disputes`
[Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/disputes/list) 
```
stripe\_loader = StripeLoader(os.environ["STRIPE\_ACCESS\_TOKEN"], "charges")
```
```
# Create a vectorstore retriver from the loader
# see https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/getting\_started.html for more details
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from\_loaders([stripe\_loader])
stripe\_doc\_retriever = index.vectorstore.as\_retriever()
```
