 Character Text Splitter
 [#](#character-text-splitter "Permalink to this headline")
=====================================================================================
 This is a more simple method. This splits based on characters (by default “\n\n”) and measure chunk length by number of characters.
1. How the text is split: by single character
2. How the chunk size is measured: by length function passed in (defaults to number of characters)
```
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open('../../../state\_of\_the\_union.txt') as f:
    state\_of\_the\_union = f.read()
```
```
from langchain.text\_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
text\_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(        
    separator = "\n\n",
    chunk\_size = 1000,
    chunk\_overlap  = 200,
    length\_function = len,
)
```
```
texts = text\_splitter.create\_documents([state\_of\_the\_union])
print(texts[0])
```
```

 Here’s an example of passing metadata along with the documents, notice that it is split along with the documents.
```
metadatas = [{"document": 1}, {"document": 2}]
documents = text\_splitter.create\_documents([state\_of\_the\_union, state\_of\_the\_union], metadatas=metadatas)
print(documents[0])
```
```
