 tiktoken (OpenAI) Length Function
 [#](#tiktoken-openai-length-function "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================================================================
 You can also use tiktoken, an open source tokenizer package from OpenAI to estimate tokens used. Will probably be more accurate for their models.
1. How the text is split: by character passed in
2. How the chunk size is measured: by
 `tiktoken`
 tokenizer
```
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open('../../../state\_of\_the\_union.txt') as f:
    state\_of\_the\_union = f.read()
from langchain.text\_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
```
```
text\_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from\_tiktoken\_encoder(chunk\_size=100, chunk\_overlap=0)
texts = text\_splitter.split\_text(state\_of\_the\_union)
```
```
print(texts[0])
```
