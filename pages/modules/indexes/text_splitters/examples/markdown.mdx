 Markdown Text Splitter
 [#](#markdown-text-splitter "Permalink to this headline")
===================================================================================
 MarkdownTextSplitter splits text along Markdown headings, code blocks, or horizontal rules. It’s implemented as a simple subclass of RecursiveCharacterSplitter with Markdown-specific separators. See the source code to see the Markdown syntax expected by default.
1. How the text is split: by list of markdown specific characters
2. How the chunk size is measured: by length function passed in (defaults to number of characters)
```
from langchain.text\_splitter import MarkdownTextSplitter

# 🦜️🔗 LangChain

## Quick Install
```bash
# Hopefully this code block isn't split
pip install langchain
```
As an open source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions.
