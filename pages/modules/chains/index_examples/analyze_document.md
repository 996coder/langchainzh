 [#](#analyze-document "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================================



 The AnalyzeDocumentChain is more of an end to chain. This chain takes in a single document, splits it up, and then runs it through a CombineDocumentsChain. This can be used as more of an end-to-end chain.
 







```
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()

 Summarize
 [#](#summarize "Permalink to this headline")

 Let’s take a look at it in action below, using it summarize a long document.
 







```
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
summary_chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")

```










```
from langchain.chains import AnalyzeDocumentChain

```










```
summarize_document_chain = AnalyzeDocumentChain(combine_docs_chain=summary_chain)

```










```
summarize_document_chain.run(state_of_the_union)

```

```










```
qa_chain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")

```










```
qa_document_chain = AnalyzeDocumentChain(combine_docs_chain=qa_chain)

```










```
qa_document_chain.run(input_document=state_of_the_union, question="what did the president say about justice breyer?")
