 Intermediate Steps

 You can also use the intermediate steps flag to return the code executed that generates the answer.
 







```
pal_chain = PALChain.from_colored_object_prompt(llm, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True)

```










```
question = "On the desk, you see two blue booklets, two purple booklets, and two yellow pairs of sunglasses. If I remove all the pairs of sunglasses from the desk, how many purple items remain on it?"

```










```
result = pal_chain({"question": question})

```








```
> Entering new PALChain chain...
# Put objects into a list to record ordering
objects = []
objects += [('booklet', 'blue')] \* 2
objects += [('booklet', 'purple')] \* 2
objects += [('sunglasses', 'yellow')] \* 2

# Remove all pairs of sunglasses
objects = [object for object in objects if object[0] != 'sunglasses']

# Count number of purple objects
num_purple = len([object for object in objects if object[1] == 'purple'])
answer = num_purple

> Finished chain.

```










```
result['intermediate_steps']

```
