 LengthBased ExampleSelector
 [#](#lengthbased-exampleselector "Permalink to this headline")
=============================================================================================
 This ExampleSelector selects which examples to use based on length. This is useful when you are worried about constructing a prompt that will go over the length of the context window. For longer inputs, it will select fewer examples to include, while for shorter inputs it will select more.
```
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.example\_selector import LengthBasedExampleSelector
```
```
# These are a lot of examples of a pretend task of creating antonyms.
examples = [
    {"input": "happy", "output": "sad"},
    {"input": "tall", "output": "short"},
    {"input": "energetic", "output": "lethargic"},
    {"input": "sunny", "output": "gloomy"},
    {"input": "windy", "output": "calm"},
]
```
```
example\_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input\_variables=["input", "output"],
    template="Input: {input}\nOutput: {output}",

example\_selector = LengthBasedExampleSelector(
    # These are the examples it has available to choose from.
    examples=examples, 
    # This is the PromptTemplate being used to format the examples.
    example\_prompt=example\_prompt, 
    # This is the maximum length that the formatted examples should be.
    # Length is measured by the get\_text\_length function below.
    max\_length=25,
    # This is the function used to get the length of a string, which is used
    # to determine which examples to include. It is commented out because
    # it is provided as a default value if none is specified.
    # get\_text\_length: Callable[[str], int] = lambda x: len(re.split("\n| ", x))
)
dynamic\_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    # We provide an ExampleSelector instead of examples.
    example\_selector=example\_selector,
    example\_prompt=example\_prompt,
    prefix="Give the antonym of every input",
    suffix="Input: {adjective}\nOutput:", 
    input\_variables=["adjective"],
)
```
```
# An example with small input, so it selects all examples.
print(dynamic\_prompt.format(adjective="big"))

Give the antonym of every input
Input: happy
Output: sad
Input: tall
Output: short
Input: energetic
Output: lethargic
Input: sunny
Output: gloomy
Input: windy
Output: calm
Input: big
Output:

Give the antonym of every input
Input: happy
Output: sad
Input: big and huge and massive and large and gigantic and tall and much much much much much bigger than everything else
