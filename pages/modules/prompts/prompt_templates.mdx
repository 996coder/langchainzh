[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/prompts/prompt-template) 
 Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt.
Typically this is not simply a hardcoded string but rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.
 The following sections of documentation are provided:
* [Getting Started](./prompt_templates/getting_started.html)
