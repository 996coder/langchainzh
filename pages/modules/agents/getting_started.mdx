ighest level API, we will only use the `InteractiveAgent` class, which allows for interactive communication with the agent.
* AgentConfig: The configuration for the agent, such as the LLM model to use, the maximum number of steps to take, and the initial context for the conversation.

To get started, you'll need to install the OpenAI API package and authenticate with your API key. Then you can create an instance of the `OpenAI` class and use it to create an agent with the desired parameters.

To use the `InteractiveAgent` class, you simply need to call the `ask()` method on the agent object with your input text. The agent will then generate a response based on its understanding of the input and any previous context.

With these basic concepts in mind, you can start experimenting with agents and exploring their potential applications in your own projects.
