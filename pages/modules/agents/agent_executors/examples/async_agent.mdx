gent_executor.execute_async()`
 method to run async methods for Agents. Simply pass in the name of the tool and the method to execute as arguments. For example:

```
result = await agent_executor.execute_async("SerpAPIWrapper", "search", query="python")
```

This will execute the `search` method of the `SerpAPIWrapper` tool asynchronously, with the `query` parameter set to `"python"`. The `result` variable will contain the result of the async method.

Note that the `execute_async()` method returns a coroutine, so you will need to use the `await` keyword to retrieve the result.

Using the async API for Agents can greatly improve the efficiency of your language processing tasks. Give it a try and see the difference for yourself!
