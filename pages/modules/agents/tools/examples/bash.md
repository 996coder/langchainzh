 Shell Tool
 [#](#shell-tool "Permalink to this headline")
===========================================================



 Giving agents access to the shell is powerful (though risky outside a sandboxed environment).
 



 The LLM can use it to execute any shell commands. A common use case for this is letting the LLM interact with your local file system.
 







```
from langchain.tools import ShellTool

shell_tool = ShellTool()

```










```
print(shell_tool.run({"commands": ["echo 'Hello World!'", "time"]}))

```








```
Hello World!

real	0m0.000s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.000s

```

 Use with Agents
 [#](#use-with-agents "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------



 As with all tools, these can be given to an agent to accomplish more complex tasks. Letâ€™s have the agent fetch some links from a web page.
 







```
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

shell_tool.description = shell_tool.description + f"args {shell_tool.args}".replace("{", "{{").replace("}", "}}")
self_ask_with_search = initialize_agent([shell_tool], llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
self_ask_with_search.run("Download the langchain.com webpage and grep for all urls. Return only a sorted list of them. Be sure to use double quotes.")

```








```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Question: What is the task?
Thought: We need to download the langchain.com webpage and extract all the URLs from it. Then we need to sort the URLs and return them.
Action:
```
{
 "action": "shell",
 "action_input": {
 "commands": [
 "curl -s https://langchain.com | grep -o 'http[s]\*://[^\" ]\*' | sort"
 ]
 }
}
```

Thought:The URLs have been successfully extracted and sorted. We can return the list of URLs as the final answer.
