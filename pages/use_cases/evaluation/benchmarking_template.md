 Benchmarking Template
 [#](#benchmarking-template "Permalink to this headline")
=================================================================================



 This is an example notebook that can be used to create a benchmarking notebook for a task of your choice. Evaluation is really hard, and so we greatly welcome any contributions that can make it easier for people to experiment
 



 It is highly reccomended that you do any evaluation/benchmarking with tracing enabled. See
 [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tracing) 
 for an explanation of what tracing is and how to set it up.
 







```
# Comment this out if you are NOT using tracing
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_HANDLER"] = "langchain"

```







 Loading the data
 [#](#loading-the-data "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 First, letâ€™s load the data.
 







```
# This notebook should so how to load the dataset from LangChainDatasets on Hugging Face

# Please upload your dataset to https://huggingface.co/LangChainDatasets

# The value passed into `load_dataset` should NOT have the `LangChainDatasets/` prefix
from langchain.evaluation.loading import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("TODO")

```








 Setting up a chain
 [#](#setting-up-a-chain "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



 This next section should have an example of setting up a chain that can be run on this dataset.
 





 Make a prediction
 [#](#make-a-prediction "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



 First, we can make predictions one datapoint at a time. Doing it at this level of granularity allows use to explore the outputs in detail, and also is a lot cheaper than running over multiple datapoints
 







```
# Example of running the chain on a single datapoint (`dataset[0]`) goes here

```








 Make many predictions
 [#](#make-many-predictions "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Now we can make predictions.
 







```
# Example of running the chain on many predictions goes here

# Sometimes its as simple as `chain.apply(dataset)`

# Othertimes you may want to write a for loop to catch errors

```
