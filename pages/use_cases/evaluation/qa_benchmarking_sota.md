 Question Answering Benchmarking: State of the Union Address
 [#](#question-answering-benchmarking-state-of-the-union-address "Permalink to this headline")
============================================================================================================================================================



 Here we go over how to benchmark performance on a question answering task over a state of the union address.
 



 It is highly reccomended that you do any evaluation/benchmarking with tracing enabled. See
 [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tracing) 
 for an explanation of what tracing is and how to set it up.
 







```
# Comment this out if you are NOT using tracing
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_HANDLER"] = "langchain"

```







 Loading the data
 [#](#loading-the-data "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 First, letâ€™s load the data.
 







```
from langchain.evaluation.loading import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("question-answering-state-of-the-union")

```








```
Found cached dataset json (/Users/harrisonchase/.cache/huggingface/datasets/LangChainDatasets___json/LangChainDatasets--question-answering-state-of-the-union-a7e5a3b2db4f440d/0.0.0/0f7e3662623656454fcd2b650f34e886a7db4b9104504885bd462096cc7a9f51)

```

 Setting up a chain
 [#](#setting-up-a-chain "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Now we need to create some pipelines for doing question answering. Step one in that is creating an index over the data in question.
 







```
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader("../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt")

```










```
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator

```










```
vectorstore = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader]).vectorstore

```








```
Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.

```






 Now we can create a question answering chain.
 







```
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

```










```
chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), input_key="question")

```








 Make a prediction
 [#](#make-a-prediction "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



 First, we can make predictions one datapoint at a time. Doing it at this level of granularity allows use to explore the outputs in detail, and also is a lot cheaper than running over multiple datapoints
 







```
chain(dataset[0])

```








```
{'question': 'What is the purpose of the NATO Alliance?',
 'answer': 'The purpose of the NATO Alliance is to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.',
 'result': ' The NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.'}

```








 Make many predictions
 [#](#make-many-predictions "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Now we can make predictions
 







```
predictions = chain.apply(dataset)

```








 Evaluate performance
 [#](#evaluate-performance "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Now we can evaluate the predictions. The first thing we can do is look at them by eye.
 







```
predictions[0]

```








```
{'question': 'What is the purpose of the NATO Alliance?',
 'answer': 'The purpose of the NATO Alliance is to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.',
 'result': ' The purpose of the NATO Alliance is to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.'}

```






 Next, we can use a language model to score them programatically
 







```
from langchain.evaluation.qa import QAEvalChain

```










```
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
eval_chain = QAEvalChain.from_llm(llm)
graded_outputs = eval_chain.evaluate(dataset, predictions, question_key="question", prediction_key="result")

```






 We can add in the graded output to the
 `predictions`
 dict and then get a count of the grades.
 







```
for i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
    prediction['grade'] = graded_outputs[i]['text']

```










```
from collections import Counter
Counter([pred['grade'] for pred in predictions])

```








```
Counter({' CORRECT': 7, ' INCORRECT': 4})

```






 We can also filter the datapoints to the incorrect examples and look at them.
 







```
incorrect = [pred for pred in predictions if pred['grade'] == " INCORRECT"]

```










```
incorrect[0]

```








```
{'question': 'What is the U.S. Department of Justice doing to combat the crimes of Russian oligarchs?',
 'answer': 'The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.',
 'result': ' The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs and is naming a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.',
 'grade': ' INCORRECT'}

```
