 Welcome to LangChain
 [#](#welcome-to-langchain "Permalink to this headline")
===============================================================================



 LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:
 


* *Be data-aware* 
 : connect a language model to other sources of data
* *Be agentic* 
 : allow a language model to interact with its environment



 The LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.
 



 This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see
 [here](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) 
 . For the JavaScript documentation, see

 Getting Started
 [#](#getting-started "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------



 Checkout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.

 Modules
 [#](#modules "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------



 There are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.
For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.
These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:
 


* [Models](./modules/models.html) 
 : The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.
* [Prompts](./modules/prompts.html) 
 : This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.
* [Memory](./modules/memory.html) 
 : Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.
* [Indexes](./modules/indexes.html) 
 : Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.
* [Chains](./modules/chains.html) 
 : Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.
* [Agents](./modules/agents.html) 
 : Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.







 Use Cases
 [#](#use-cases "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------



 The above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.
 


* [Autonomous Agents](./use_cases/autonomous_agents.html) 
 : Autonomous agents are long running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.
* [Agent Simulations](./use_cases/agent_simulations.html) 
 : Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other or to events can be an interesting way to observe their long-term memory abilities.
* [Personal Assistants](./use_cases/personal_assistants.html) 
 : The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.
* [Question Answering](./use_cases/question_answering.html) 
 : The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.
* [Chatbots](./use_cases/chatbots.html) 
 : Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.
* [Querying Tabular Data](./use_cases/tabular.html) 
 : If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.
* [Code Understanding](./use_cases/code.html) 
 : If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query source code from github, you should read this page.
* [Interacting with APIs](./use_cases/apis.html) 
 : Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.
* [Extraction](./use_cases/extraction.html) 
 : Extract structured information from text.
* [Summarization](./use_cases/summarization.html) 
 : Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.
* [Evaluation](./use_cases/evaluation.html) 
 : Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.
